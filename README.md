# simple-shell-clock

## Description

The Simple Shell Clock is intended to be a simple and reliable digital clock for your Linux shell. The idea to create such a script came after trying to find a simple shell script or python script to do the same thing online. I couldn't find one that I actually liked, and that was easy to customise, so I created my own.

## Usage

```
$ python3.7 ~/Downloads/simple-shell-clock/main.py
```

## Planned Features

- Font customisation (figlet).
- Colour customisation.
- Padding & general tidiness.
